# Name: TImothy W Garton
# Project: CS 567 - 3D User Interfaces
# Description: This project as proposed is going to be a 3D first person user interface with keyboard input and monitor graphic output.  The user will navigate through a 3D maze trying to avoid hazards in place in the path. Testing will take place by recording how quick a subject can make it through the maze and tracking how many obstacles the avoided or interacted with.

# For checkpoint 1, Git has been setup and the repository cloned down to my local instance.  For this Checkpoint, I am installing Unreal 4 and making sure that the hardware is capable of running the software for development.  Options for automatically generated mazes are being investigated.
