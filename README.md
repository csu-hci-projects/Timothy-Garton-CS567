# Name: TImothy W Garton
# Project: CS 567 - 3D User Interfaces
# Description: This project as proposed is going to be a 3D first person user interface with keyboard input and monitor graphic output.  The user will navigate through a 3D maze trying to avoid hazards in place in the path. Testing will take place by recording how quick a subject can make it through the maze and tracking how many obstacles the avoided or interacted with.

# For Checkpoint 1, Git has been setup and the repository cloned down to my local instance.  For this Checkpoint, I am installing Unreal 4 and making sure that the hardware is capable of running the software for development.  Options for automatically generated mazes are being investigated.

# For Checkpoint 2, Git has been initialized with a default Unreal 4 ignore file, readme file, and the the initial upload of an Unreal 4 First Person Template for the basis of my software development.  Additional options for open source mazes are still being investigated as well for quicker testing environment development.

# For Checkpoint 3, Maze Creator template and Sweet Home 3D are being investigated and compared for generation of a city block maze.  I have tested generation of mazes using the Maze Creator template, and will most likely move forward with my own custom 3D maze since the settings do not allow for a realistic block layout, but rather a symmetric hallway maze with various rooms.
